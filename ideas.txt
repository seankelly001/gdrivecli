concurrent operations (upload download etc)
add current things to queue (seperat window or?)

arrange by last modified, filter text

- Upload to Gdrive
- Check disk space before download
- Jump to on FS tree
- download entire folder (keep structure?)
- sort by last modified

far future: multiple seperate structures (e.g. multiple gdrives, azure, aws, linux fs etc)

design:
interface: explorer
methods: delve/to/from/open dir


----
interface FileSystemTree

func GetChildren()
func SetChildren()
